But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses : because it is she that I have watered ; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe ; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen ; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars ( except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies ) ; because it is she that I have listened to , when she grumbled , or boasted , or ever sometimes when she said nothing . (lpp_1943.1168)
